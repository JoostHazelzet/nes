Development Notes

Improvements and Corrections
----------------------------
  - Error:  Test failures:
             |-- BRK test failure
             \-- VBlank timing
  - Error: Cutting off sprites in top few pixels (SMB)
  - Error: sprites not rendering in first 8 pixels of screen (left) column
             |-- is this an error or a correct glitch? Or deliberate (see flag)
  - Error: sprites overlapping weirdly

  - New: APU and audio!
             |-- APU code
             \-- playing sound (peripheral)
  - New: Mappers
             |-- UxROM
             |-- MMC 1
             \-- MMC 3
  - New: Save / load emulator state
  - New: Record keypresses
  - New: Replay keypresses
  - New: run frame by frame
             |-- take input keypresses
             \-- Output frame bitmap

  - Major:  Performance
             |-- Background latches!
             |-- System -> Cython
             |-- Could move more of run_instr -> meta
             \-- Screen write from buffer
  - Major:  Code tidy up and comments
             |-- Tidy up pxd headers and constants
             |-- Localize class variables related to bkg latches if not needed
             |-- Tidy up PPU code
             |-- Tidy up unused code in ppu
             \-- initialize cython arrays
  - Major:  Test coverage
             |-- try more test ROMS
             \-- automation of testing

  - Medium:  Greyscale mode
  - Medium:  Colours boost if ppu_mask bits set
  - Medium:  Open bus behaviour on memory

  - Minor:  Background palette hack
  - Minor:  OAMDATA read behaviour during render

  - Unknown: "Vertical scroll bits reloaded" at cycles 280-304 of scanline 261 (see _new_frame())
             \-- I think this is from PPU scroll; v latch reloads bits from t latch at new frame, I think
