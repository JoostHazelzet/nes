Development Notes
-----------------

Improvements and Corrections
----------------------------
  - Error:  Test failures:
              |-- BRK test failure
              \-- VBlank timing
  - Error:  Duck Tales scrolls the wrong way on vertical scroll!
  - Error:  Duck Tales has some sort of problem that causes status bar to disappear when character gets on it
  - Error:  A bit short (about 50) of CPU cycles per cycle.  Why?

  - Emulator: Save / load emulator state
  - Emulator: Record / replay keypresses
  - Emulator: run frame by frame
                |-- take input keypresses
                \-- output frame bitmap, audio
  - Emulator: options file
  - Emulator: GUI for startup?

  - New:  OpenGL shaders
             |-- CRT
             \-- smoothing

  - Major:  APU Improvements
             |-- (Maybe done: DMC - need to find a game that uses it to test)
             |-- Generate IRQ from DMC
             \-- Interrupt flags in status register
  - Major: Mappers
             |-- MMC 1
             \-- MMC 3
  - Major:  Code tidy up and comments
             |-- Tidy up pxd headers and constants
             |-- Localize class variables related to bkg latches if not needed
             |-- Tidy up PPU code
             |-- Tidy up unused code in ppu
             \-- initialize cython arrays
  - Major:  Test coverage
             |-- try more test ROMS
             |-- make some tests (use cc65?) of our own
             \-- automation of testing

  - Medium:  Screen
              |-- Better handling of sync, vsync, etc.
              |-- nicer OSD
              \-- more efficient copy to texture?
  - Medium:  Fine timing details
              |-- can some of these be improved?
              |-- vsync length
              |-- frame length
              \-- etc.
  - Medium:  PPU Details
             |-- Greyscale mode
             |-- Colours boost if ppu_mask bits set
             |-- implement sprite overflow incorrect behaviour
             |-- sprite zero hit details
             \-- odd nametable fetches used by MMC5
  - Medium:  Open bus behaviour on memory
              \-- including controllers
  - Medium:  check IRQ implementation works
              \-- is used in a few places on the NES:  https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/IRQ

  - Minor:  colliding and lost interrupts
              \-- http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=6502_Timing_of_Interrupt_Handling
  - Minor:  Background palette hack
  - Minor:  OAMDATA read behaviour during render
  - Minor:  Performance
             |-- Background latches
             |-- Palette cache (don't need to invalidate all, check hit rate)
             \-- Could move more of run_instr -> meta

  - Unknown: "Vertical scroll bits reloaded" at cycles 280-304 of scanline 261 (see _new_frame())
             \-- I think this is from PPU scroll; v latch reloads bits from t latch at new frame, I think
