Improvements and Corrections
----------------------------
  - Error:  Test failures:
             |-- BRK test failure
             \-- VBlank timing
  - Error: Cutting off sprites in top few pixels (SMB)
             |-- Could be the bkg clear thing
  - Error: sprites not rendering in first 8 pixels of screen (left) column
             |-- is this an error or a correct glitch?
  - Error: sprites overlapping weirdly


  - Major:  Code tidy up and comments
  - Major:  Scrolling
             |-- fine y scrolling
             \-- test y scrolling (coarse and fine)
  - Major:  Test coverage
             |-- try more test ROMS
             \-- automation of testing

  - Medium:  Greyscale mode
  - Medium:  Colours boost if ppu_mask bits set
  - Medium:  Open bus behaviour on memory

  - Minor:  Background palette hack
  - Minor:  OAMDATA read behaviour during render

  - Unknown: "Vertical scroll bits reloaded" at cycles 280-304 of scanline 261 (see _new_frame())
